## Processing project to check if polygons become regular with infinite recursive inscription (and no, they don't)
Some keybindings available:
- space: reset
- +: faster
- -: slower
- l: midpoint more on the right
- k: midpoint more on the left

The initial polygon is completely random.
All the parameters are configurable.
